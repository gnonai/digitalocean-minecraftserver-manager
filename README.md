digitalocean-minecraftserver-manager
===========================

This is a fork of the work done by srccd: https://github.com/srccd/digitalocean-tekkit-manager

I had the same issue: kids + minecraft + servers + digitalocean = potentially expensive in time and money

This script works to rebalance that equation by letting the kids manage the server droplet on Digital Ocean themselves, in a safe way, and only run it when they are going to use it, in a money-saving way.

My fork adds the server/snapshot names and does some minor page formatting.

Might swap out the text+links to a more simpler workflow style view.
